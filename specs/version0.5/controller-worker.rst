==================================
Controller Worker (deploy-worker)
==================================

Launchpad blueprint:

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/octavia/+spec/controller-worker

Octavia is an operator-grade reference implementation for Load Balancing as a
Service (LBaaS) for OpenStack.  The component of Octavia that does the load
balancing is known as Amphora.

The component of Octavia that provides command and control of the Amphora is
the Octavia controller.

Problem description
===================

Components of the Octavia controller require a shared library that provides
the orchestration of create/update/delete actions for Octavia objects such as
load balancers and listeners.

It is expected that this library will be used by the Queue Consumer to service
API requests, by the Housekeeping Manager to manage the spare Amphora pool,
and by the Health Manager to fail over failed objects.

Proposed change
===============

The Controller Worker will be implemented as a class that provides methods to
facilitate the create/update/delete actions.  This class will be responsible
for managing the number of simultaneous operations being executed by
coordinating through the Octavia database.

The Controller Worker will provide a base class that sets up and initilizes
the TaskFlow engines required to complete the action.  Users of the library
will then call the appropriate method for the action.  These methods setup
and launch the appropriate flow.  Each flow will be contained in a seperate
class for code reuse and supportability.

The Controller Worker library will provide the following methods:

        """Creates an Amphora.

        :returns: amphora_id
        """

Alternatives
------------
This code could be included in the Queue Consumer component of the controller.
However this would not allow the library to be shared with other components of
the controller, such as the Health Manager
